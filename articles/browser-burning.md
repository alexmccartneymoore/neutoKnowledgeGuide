## Browsers may not seem like complicated pieces of software but the fast and accurate translation of web data into attractive visual representations that we refer to as ‘websites’ is a difficult task. These ‘windows to the web’ are often built in different ways and this has a significant impact on the energy they consume while in use.

### Overall performance
The website [Greenspector](https://greenspector.com) has published a study showing where and how modern web browsers use energy. The overall rankings convey some surprising findings with the lesser-known [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) browser performing best, followed by two equally rare browsers Firefox Preview and DuckDuckGo – both mainly suited for mobile devices. 
The well known browser [Chrome](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/), built by Google, sits in the centre of the overall rankings, beside [Opera](https://www.opera.com/). Much further down the rankings we see [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) (which is built on the V8 engine) and then last place goes to [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/).
We should note that the Safari browser was not included in this study.

### Energy usage
In order to work out which browser is most carbon efficient we need to look directly at energy consumption rankings. In the ‘Overall Energy Consumption’ list from  [Greenspector](https://greenspector.com/en/what-are-the-best-web-browsers-to-use-in-2020/) we find browsers in a slightly different order. 
Ecosia (mobile-only), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), and [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) browsers perform best in this category. These are followed by  [Chrome](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/) , which again does well but not well enough to be placed in the top five. [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) built by Microsoft is to be found, well, near the edge again between the herd of well-performing browsers and the few that consume much more energy. The worst-performing browser for energy consumption is [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/), which consumes about twice as much energy while browsing as Vivaldi and Opera.

### Our conclusion
Everyone has their browser preferences, but why not try out one of the better-performing browsers and give your carbon footprint a wee improvement? We will certainly be giving [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) and [Opera](https://www.opera.com/) another look.
